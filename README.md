# electron-esri-map

Prototype app for demonstrating basic functionality between ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.18 ESM, Webpack 5 and Electron.

I used Webpack to build the intial app via `npm run startwp` and I watched for changes at http://localhost:3001/. 

Then for the final test, I used `npm run build` to create a production build via webpack and launch Electron.
